On the other hand, there is nothing in place now to prevent you from doing something really stupid, except your own good sense. See that you remember to use it! \nBe the truly secure individual who stays calm under uncertain circumstances by tuning in to a newly emerging future flow. Watch closely and learn a creative new way of approaching your career and work.'},
