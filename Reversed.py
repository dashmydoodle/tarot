reversedFoolMeaning = [
    {'name' : 'The Fool', 'meaning' : 'When the Fool card is reversed, you are encountering an unfinished side of yourself, a part still caught in the shadows of ignorance or immaturity. An emotional reflex or psychological attitude could be holding you back from responding authentically and naturally. \nRelease yourself from any dogmas or taboos so your natural truthfulness and instinct for right action can be restored.'},

reversedMagicianMeaning = [
    {'name' : 'The Magician', 'meaning' : 'The Magician card reversed suggests you may be working against your own creativity. Perhaps you feel that your ideas are too scandalous or too precedent breaking. Perhaps you feel it should be someone else who communicates these insights or challenges. Perhaps you are uncomfortable with taking a leadership position, even a temporary one. \nAsk yourself what you have to lose. Have the courage of your convictions and speak your truth.'},

reversedPriestessReading = [
    {'name' : 'The High Priestess', 'meaning' : 'The High Priestess card reversed suggests that when you have problems, it\'s usually because you are so attracted to your inner life that it has become an addiction in itself. It blots out your interest in ordinary reality, friends, and family -- the connections that hold us fast to our worldly identities. \nDon\'t take this card as permission to abandon the world. This is a reminder to balance your outer identifications with internal cultivation, so you can more effectively bring the spiritual world to the material world.'},
