Started the first file - a deck of Major Arcana, which contains 22 cards. 
The next task is to create a  dictionary and fill in key:value for card:decription/ANSWER.

The cards will have a short description and a YES/NO short answer for users input(to be implemented).
The final code was tested and uploaded.

Decided to implement additional reading depending on the users imput. User's imput will be asked in numbers. One card will be drawn and 4 additional reading will be offered for the same card.

Each additional reading will have its own list/dict, such as 'reversedFoolReading' for easier callability.
Added the additional reading imports with '*'
